# Unit tests and Strings

Work on a clone of this repo and push to that as often as you can.   
Ask if you need any help. 


Tasks:
* cd into the tests folder
* run the tests
  * ruby tests.rb
* Go through the tests, remove the skip line and make the tests pass
  * Do one test at a time

* Use what you learned in main.rb to write a small program
  * use: puts to display information to the console
  * use: gets to read input

E.g.

```ruby
puts "What is your name:"
name = gets
puts "Your name is #{name}"
```
